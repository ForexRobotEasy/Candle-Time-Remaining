## Candle Time Remaining Indicator

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 4 that displays the remaining time for each candle on the chart. It calculates the remaining time by subtracting the current time from the time of each candle. The indicator has two buffers: Buffer1 stores the remaining time in seconds, and Buffer2 stores the remaining time in minutes.

- `xPosition`: The x position of the indicator text on the chart.
- `yPosition`: The y position of the indicator text on the chart.
- `textColor`: The color of the indicator text.
- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the indicator text.
- `fontType`: The font type of the indicator text.
- `fontSize`: The font size of the indicator text.
